## Introduction

The Sign Language Recognition Project uses deep learning techniques to recognize and classify different sign language gestures. The project leverages the ARASL Database, which contains over 54,000 images of various sign language gestures. The goal is to build an accurate model that can interpret sign language and potentially aid in communication for the hearing impaired.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [ARASL Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherryshad0/arasl-database-54k-final). This dataset contains images of 54,000 sign language gestures, providing a comprehensive foundation for training and evaluating the recognition model.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sign-Language-Recognition-Project.git
   cd Sign-Language-Recognition-Project
Install Required Libraries:
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then install the necessary Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Dataset:
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.

Usage
Prepare the Data:
Use the MAKE_DATA.ipynb notebook to preprocess the dataset and prepare it for training. This includes data augmentation, normalization, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Train the Model:
Open the AR Detection.ipynb notebook to train the machine learning model using the prepared dataset. This notebook includes the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.

Evaluate the Model:
Use the A_CAM.ipynb notebook to visualize the model's predictions and evaluate its performance on the test set. This includes generating confusion matrices and calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

Results
The trained model's performance can be evaluated using the provided evaluation metrics in the A_CAM.ipynb notebook. The results include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, and confusion matrices, providing a comprehensive overview of the model's effectiveness.
